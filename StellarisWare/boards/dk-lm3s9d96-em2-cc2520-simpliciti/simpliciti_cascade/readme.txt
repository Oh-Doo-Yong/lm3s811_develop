``Cascading End Devices'' Example

This application offers the functionality of the generic SimpliciTI
``Cascading End Devices'' example and simulates a network of alarm devices.
When an alarm is raised on any one device, the signal is cascaded through
the network and retransmitted by all the other devices receiving it.

The application can communicate with other SimpliciTI-enabled devices
running with compatible radios and running their own version of the
''Cascading End Devices'' example or with other Stellaris development
boards running this example.

To run this binary correctly, the Stellaris development board must be
equipped with an EM2 expansion board with a CC2520EM module installed in
the ``MOD1'' position (the connectors nearest the oscillator on the EM2).
Hardware platforms supporting SimpliciTI 1.1.1 with which this application
may communicate are the following:

<ul>
<li>CC2430DB</li>
<li>SmartRF04EB + CC2430EM</li>
<li>SmartRF04EB + CC2431EM</li>
<li>SmartRF05EB + CC2530EM</li>
<li>SmartRF05EB + MSP430F2618 + CC2520
<li>Stellaris Development Board + EM2 expansion board + CC2520EM</li>
</ul>

The main loop of this application wakes every 5 seconds or so and checks
its ``sensor'', in this case a button on the display labelled ``Sound
Alarm''.  If its own alarm has not been raised, it listens for alarm
messages from other devices.  If nothing is heard, the application toggles
LED1 then goes back to sleep again.  If, however, an alarm is signalled
by the local ``sensor'' or an alarm message from another device is
received, the application continually retransmits the alarm message and
toggles LED2.  In the Stellaris implementation of the application the
``LEDs'' are shown using onscreen widgets.

For additional information on running this example and an explanation of
the communication between talker and listener, see section 3.3 of the
``SimpliciTI Sample Application User's Guide'' which can be found under
C:/StellarisWare/SimpliciTI-1.1.1/Documents assuming you installed
StellarisWare in its default directory.
