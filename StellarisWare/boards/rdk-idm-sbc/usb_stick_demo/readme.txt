USB Stick Update Demo

An example to demonstrate the use of the flash-based USB stick update
program.  This example is meant to be loaded into flash memory from a USB
memory stick, using the USB stick update program (usb_stick_update),
running on the microcontroller.

After this program is built, the binary file (usb_stick_demo.bin), should
be renamed to the filename expected by usb_stick_update ("FIRMWARE.BIN" by
default) and copied to the root directory of a USB memory stick.  Then,
when the memory stick is plugged into the eval board that is running the
usb_stick_update program, this example program will be loaded into flash
and then run on the microcontroller.

This program simply displays a message on the screen and prompts the user
to press a "button" on the touch screen.  Once the button is pressed,
control is passed back to the usb_stick_update program which is still in
flash, and it will attempt to load another program from the memory stick.
This shows how a user application can force a new firmware update from the
memory stick.

This application also supports remote software update over Ethernet using
the LM Flash Programmer application.  A firmware update is initiated using
the remote update request ``magic packet'' from LM Flash Programmer.

If the flash is updated using the Ethernet method, then the usb_stick_update
program located at the beginning of flash will be erased.
