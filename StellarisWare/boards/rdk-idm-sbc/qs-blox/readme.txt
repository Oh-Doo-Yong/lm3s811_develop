Blox Game

Blox is a version of a well-known game in which you attempt to stack
falling colored blocks without leaving gaps. Blocks may be moved up or
down, rotated and dropped using onscreen widgets or an attached USB
keyboard.  When any row of the game area is filled with coloured squares,
that row is removed providing more space to drop later blocks into.  The
game ends when there is insufficient space on the playing area for a new
block to be placed on the board.  Your score accumulates over time with the
number of points awarded for dropping each block dependent upon the height
from which the block was dropped.

When playing with the USB keyboard, the controls are as follow:

<dl>
<dt>Up or Right arrow</dt>
<dd>Move the current block towards the top of the game area.</dd>
<dt>Down or Left arrow</dt>
<dd>Move the current block towards the bottom of the game area.</dd>
<dt>Space</dt>
<dd>Drop the block.</dd>
<dt>R</dt>
<dd>Rotate the block 90 degrees clockwise.</dd>
<dt>P</dt>
<dd>Pause or unpause the game.</dd>
</dl>

The game also offers a small web site which displays the current status
and allows the difficulty level to be set.  This site employs AJAX to
request an XML file containing status information from the IDM and uses
this to update the score, hiscore and state information once every 2.5
seconds.  If changes are made to the web site content in the ``fs''
directory, the file system image used by the application must be rebuilt
by running the following command from the qs-blox directory:

    makefsfile -i fs -o blox-fsdata.h -r -h

This application supports remote software update over Ethernet using the
LM Flash Programmer application.  A firmware update is initiated using the
remote update request ``magic packet'' from LM Flash Programmer.
