Access Point for ``Polling with Access Point'' example


This application offers the access point functionality of the generic
SimpliciTI Polling_with_AP example.  To run this example, two additional
SimpliciTI-enabled boards using compatible radios must also be present, one
running the sender application and the other running the receiver.  If
using the Stellaris development board, these functions are found in the
simpliciti_polling_dev example application.  On other hardware, these are
the Sender and Receiver configurations of the ``Polling_with_AP'' example
as supplied with SimpliciTI 1.1.1.

The functionality provided here is equivalent to the ``Access Point''
configuration included in the generic SimpliciTI ``Polling with AP''
example application.

To run this binary correctly, the development board must be equipped with
an EM2 expansion board with a CC1101:433 EM module installed in the
``MOD1'' position (the connectors nearest the oscillator on the EM2).
Hardware platforms supporting SimpliciTI 1.1.1 with which this application
may communicate are the following:

<ul>
<li>SmartRF04EB + CC1110EM</li>
<li>EM430F6137RF900</li>
<li>FET430F6137RF900</li>
<li>CC1111EM USB Dongle</li>
<li>EXP430FG4618 + CC1101:433 + USB Debug Interface</li>
<li>EXP430FG4618 + CC1100:433 + USB Debug Interface</li>
<li>Stellaris Development Board + EM2 expansion board + CC1101:433</li>
</ul>

To run this example, power up the access point board and both its LEDs
should light indicating that it is active.  Next, power up the receiver
board and press button 2 (or, on single button boards, press the button for
less than 3 seconds).  At this point, only LED1 on the receiver board
should be lit.  Finally power up the sender and press its button 1 (or, on
single button boards, press the button for more than 3 seconds).  Both LEDs
on the sender will blink until it successfully links with the receiver.
After successful linking, the sender will transmit a message to the
receiver every 3 to 6 seconds.  This message will be stored by the access
point and passed to the receiver the next time it polls the access point.
While the example is running, LEDs on both the sender and receiver will
blink.  No user interaction is required on the access point.

For additional information on running this example and an explanation of
the communication between the two devices and access point, see section 3.2
of the ``SimpliciTI Sample Application User's Guide'' which can be found
under C:/StellarisWare/SimpliciTI-1.1.1/Documents assuming that
StellarisWare is installed in its default directory.
