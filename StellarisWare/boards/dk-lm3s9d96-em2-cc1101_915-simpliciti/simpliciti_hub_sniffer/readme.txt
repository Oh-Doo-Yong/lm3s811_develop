Channel Sniffer for use with ``Access Point as a Data Hub'' example


This application provides channel sniffer functionality in a SimpliciTI
low power RF network.  It may be run on a development board equipped with
an EM expansion board and SimpliciTI-compatible radio board to determine
which channel the network is currently on.  Use this application alongside
the ``Access Point as a Data Hub'' example (simpliciti_hub_ap/dev) which
supports frequency agility.

The functionality provided here is equivalent to the ``Channel Sniffer''
configuration included in the generic SimpliciTI ``AP_as_Data_Hub'' example
application.

To run this binary correctly, the development board must be equipped with
an EM2 expansion board with a CC1101:868/915 EM module installed in the
``MOD1'' position (the connectors nearest the oscillator on the EM2).
Hardware platforms supporting SimpliciTI 1.1.1 with which this application
may communicate are the following:

<ul>
<li>SmartRF04EB + CC1110EM</li>
<li>EM430F6137RF900</li>
<li>FET430F6137RF900</li>
<li>CC1111EM USB Dongle</li>
<li>EXP430FG4618 + CC1101:868/915 + USB Debug Interface</li>
<li>EXP430FG4618 + CC1100:868/915 + USB Debug Interface</li>
<li>Stellaris Development Board + EM2 expansion board + CC1101:868/915</li>
</ul>

At least one additional board is required to run this application and two
additional boards are needed to show all features of the ``Access Point as
a Data Hub'' example.  If running the sniffer application with only one
other board, make sure that that board is running the access point binary,
simpliciti_hub_ap from StellarisWare or the relevant access point
configuration of the generic SimpliciTI ``Ap_as_Data_Hub'' example if
running the access point on a different hardware platform.

Start the board running the sniffer application and both LEDs on the screen
will flash until the board joins the access point's network.  After the
network is joined the LEDs will indicate the current SimpliciTI channel
number in binary.  The channel number is also displayed in text at the
bottom of the screen.  To change the network channel, press button 1 on
the board running the access point software.

For additional information on running this example and an explanation of
the communication between the two devices and access point, see section
3.4.2 of the ``SimpliciTI Sample Application User's Guide'' which can be
found under C:/StellarisWare/SimpliciTI-1.1.1/Documents assuming
that StellarisWare is installed in its default directory.
