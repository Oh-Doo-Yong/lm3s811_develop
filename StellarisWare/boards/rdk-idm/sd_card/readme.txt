SD card using FAT file system

This example application demonstrates reading a file system from
an SD card.  It makes use of FatFs, a FAT file system driver.  It
provides a simple widget-based console on the display and also a UART-based
command line for viewing and navigating the file system on the SD card.

For additional details about FatFs, see the following site:
http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html

UART1, which is connected to the 3 pin header on the underside of the
IDM RDK board (J2), is configured for 115,200 bits per second, and
8-n-1 mode.  When the program is started a message will be printed to the
terminal.  Type ``help'' for command help.

To connect the IDM RDK board's UART to a 9 pin PC serial port, use a
standard male to female DB9 serial cable and connect TXD (J2 pin 1, nearest
the SD card socket) to pin 2 of the male serial cable connector, RXD (J2
pin 2, the center pin) to pin 3 of the serial connector and GND (J2 pin 3)
to pin 5 of the serial connector.

This application supports remote software update over Ethernet using the
LM Flash Programmer application.  A firmware update is initiated using the
remote update request ``magic packet'' from LM Flash Programmer.  This
feature is available in versions of LM Flash Programmer with build numbers
greater than 560.
