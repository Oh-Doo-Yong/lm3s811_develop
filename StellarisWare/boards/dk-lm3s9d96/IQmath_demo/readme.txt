IQmath Demonstration

This application demonstrates the use of the IQmath library, allowing the
performance relative to floating-point to be easily seen.  A dodecahedron
is rotated in 3-space and displayed on the screen.  Each face of the
dodecahedron has a Stellaris logo on it, bring the total vertex count to
704 (i.e. the number of points that are rotated in 3-space for every frame
that is displayed).

When first started, the IQmath library will be used to rotate the
dodecahedron (as indicated by the status line at the bottom of the
display).  The user push button on the lower right corner of the board will
switch between using IQmath and floating-point math.
