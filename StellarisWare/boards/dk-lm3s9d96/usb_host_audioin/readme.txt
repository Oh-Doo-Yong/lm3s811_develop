USB host audio example application using a USB audio device for input
and I2S for output.

This example application demonstrates streaming audio from a USB audio
device that supports recording an audio source at 48000 16 bit stereo.
The application will start recording audio from the USB audio device when
the "Play" button is pressed and stream it to the I2S output on the board.
Because some audio devices require more power, you may need to use an
external 5 volt supply to provide enough power to the USB audio device.
