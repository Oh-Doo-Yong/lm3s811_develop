I2S Record and Playback with Speex codec

This example application demonstrates recording audio from the codec's ADC,
transferring the audio over the I2S receive interface to the
microcontroller, encoding the audio using a Speex encoder and then decoding
the audio and sending the audio back to the codec via the I2S transmit
interface.  A line level audio source should be fed into the LINE IN
audio jack which will be recorded with the codec's ADC and then played back
through both the HEADPHONE and LINE OUT jacks.  The application provides a
simple command line interface via the virtual COM port.  To get the list
of supported commands, connect a serial communication program to the
virtual COM port at 115200, no parity, 8 data bits, one stop bit.  The
"help" command will provide a list of valid commands.  The current commands
are "bypass" which will disable the Speex encoder and will pass the audio
directly from input to output unmodified but still using the I2S record
data.  This is useful for hearing the audio at the current audio resolution
without any encoding and decoding.  The "speex" command takes and integer
quality parameter that ranges from 0-4.  The larger the number the higher
the quality setting for the encoder.

This application requires some modifications to the default jumpers on the
board in order for the audio record path to function correctly.  The
PD4/LD4 jumper should be removed and placed on the PD4/RXSD jumper to
receive I2S data.  The PD4/LD4 is located in the row of jumpers near the
LCD connector while the PD4/RXSD jumper is in the row near the audio jacks.

\note Moving this jumper will cause the LCD to not function for other
applications so the jumper should be moved back to run other applications.
