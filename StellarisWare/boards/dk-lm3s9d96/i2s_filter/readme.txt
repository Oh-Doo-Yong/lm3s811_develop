I2S Record and Playback

This example application demonstrates recording audio from the codec's ADC,
transferring the audio over the I2S receive interface to the
microcontroller, and then sending the audio back to the codec via the I2S
trasmit interface.  A line level audio source should be fed into the LINE IN
audio jack which will be recorded with the codec's ADC and then played back
through both the HEADPHONE and LINE OUT jacks.  This application requires
some modifications to the default jumpers on the board in order for the
audio record path to function correctly.  The PD4/LD4 jumper should be
removed and placed on the PD4/RXSD jumper to receive I2S data.  The PD4/LD4
is located in the row of jumpers near the LCD connector while the PD4/RXSD
jumper is in the row near the audio jacks.

\note Moving this jumper will cause the LCD to not function for other
applications so the jumper should be moved back to run other applications.
