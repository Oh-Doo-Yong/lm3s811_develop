Daughter Board EEPROM Read/Write Example

This application may be used to read and write the ID structures written
into the 128 byte EEPROMs found on the optional Flash/SRAM and FPGA
daughter boards for the development board.  A command line interface is
provided via UART 0 and commands allow the existing ID EEPROM content to be
read and one of the standard structures identifying the available daughter
boards to be written to the device.

The ID EEPROM is read in function PinoutSet() and used to configure the
EPI interface appropriately for the attached daughter board.  If the EEPROM
content is incorrect, this auto-configuration will not be possible and
example applications will typically show merely a blank display when run.
