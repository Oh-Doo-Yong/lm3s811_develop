USB HID Keyboard Device

This example application turns the evaluation board into a USB keyboard
supporting the Human Interface Device class.  The color STN display shows a
virtual keyboard which can be navigated using the direction control button
on the board.  Pressing down on the button presses the highlighted key,
sending its usage code and, if necessary, a shift modifier, to the USB
host.  The board status LED is used to indicate the current Caps Lock state
and is updated in response to pressing the ``Caps'' key on the virtual
keyboard or any other keyboard attached to the same USB host system.

The device implemented by this application also supports USB remote wakeup
allowing it to request the host to reactivate a suspended bus.  If the bus
is suspended (as indicated on the application display), pressing the
Select key will request a remote wakeup assuming the host has not
specifically disabled such requests.
