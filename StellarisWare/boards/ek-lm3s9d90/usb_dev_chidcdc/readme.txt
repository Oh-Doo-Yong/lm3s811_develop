USB composite HID Mouse and CDC serial Device

This example application turns the evaluation board into a composite USB
mouse supporting the Human Interface Device class and a CDC serial device
The mouse pointer will move in a square pattern for the duration of the
time it is plugged in.  The serial port is used as a command prompt to
change the behavior of the board.  By default the mouse will simply
enumerate and not move.  The serial port can then be opened and a command
can be issued to start the mouse moving or stop it again.

The commands supported by the UART are the following:

? or help or h - Will display the help message.

led <on|off|toggle|activity>
* on       - Turns on the LED.
* off      - Turns off the LED
* toggle   - Toggle the LED
* activity - Toggle the LED due to serial activity.

mouse <on|off>
* on  - Starts the mouse moving in a square pattern.
* off - Stops the mouse moving.

Assuming you installed StellarisWare in the default directory, a driver
information (INF) file for use with Windows XP, Windows Vista and
Windows7 can be found in C:/StellarisWare/windows_drivers. For Windows
2000, the required INF file is in C:/StellarisWare/windows_drivers/win2K.
