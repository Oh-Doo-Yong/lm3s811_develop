uDMA with Timer Edge Capture

This example application demonstrates the use of the timer edge capture
mode to trigger DMA transfers whenever there is an edge capture event.
A timer is configured for edge capture mode using CCP1 on pin PD7.  The
uDMA controller is configured to transfer the captured edge value to a
buffer until a certain number of edges have been captured.  A PWM output
is configured to generate a square wave on GPIO port bit PD0 to use as
an input source for the CCP1 pin.  In order to run the example, the pins
PD0 and PD7 must be jumpered together.

After a certain number of edges have been captured, the DMA transfer will
be complete.  The example program will print out the captured values.

UART0, connected to the FTDI virtual COM port and running at 115,200,
8-N-1, is used to display messages from this application.
