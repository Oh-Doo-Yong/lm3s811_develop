uDMA with Timer

This example application demonstrates the use of the timer to trigger
periodic DMA transfers.  A timer is configured for periodic operation.
The uDMA controller channel is configured to perform a transfer when
requested from the timer.  For the purposes of this demonstration, the
data that is transferred is the value of a separate free-running timer.
However in a real application the data transferred could be to/from memory
or a peripheral.

After a small number of transfers are performed, the captured timer values
are compared to make sure the expected duration elapsed between transfers.
The results are printed out.

UART0, connected to the FTDI virtual COM port and running at 115,200,
8-N-1, is used to display messages from this application.
