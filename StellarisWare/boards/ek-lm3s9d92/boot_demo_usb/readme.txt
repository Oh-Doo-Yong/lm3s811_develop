USB Boot Loader Example

This example application is used in conjunction with the USB boot loader
(boot_usb) and turns the evaluation board into a composite device
supporting a mouse via the Human Interface Device class and also publishing
runtime Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) capability.  Make sure that the USB
boot loader is flashed at address 0 and that the binary for this
application is placed at 0x1800.  When connected to a host system, the
application acts as a mouse and moves the pointer in a square pattern for
the duration of the time it is plugged in.

Since the device also publishes a DFU interface, host software such as the
dfuprog tool can determine that the device is capable of receiving software
updates over USB.  The runtime DFU protocol allows such tools to signal the
device to switch into DFU mode and prepare to receive a new software image.

Runtime DFU functionality requires only that the device listen for a
particular request (DETACH) from the host and, when this is received,
transfer control to the USB boot loader via the normal means to reenumerate
as a pure DFU device capable of uploading and downloading firmware images.

Windows device drivers for both the runtime and DFU mode of operation can
be found in C:/StellarisWare/windows_drivers assuming you installed
StellarisWare in the default directory.

To illustrate runtime DFU capability, use the <tt>dfuprog</tt> tool which
is part of the Stellaris Windows USB Examples package (SW-USB-win-xxxx.msi)
Assuming this package is installed in the default location, the
<tt>dfuprog</tt> executable can be found in the
<tt>C:/Program Files/Texas Instruments/Stellaris/usb_examples</tt>
directory.

With the device connected to your PC and the device driver installed, enter
the following command to enumerate DFU devices:

<tt>dfuprog -e</tt>

This will list all DFU-capable devices found and you should see that you
have one device available which is in ``Runtime'' mode.  Entering the
following command will switch this device into DFU mode and leave it ready
to receive a new firmware image:

<tt>dfuprog -m</tt>

After entering this command, you should notice that the device disconnects
from the USB bus and reconnects again. Running ``<tt>dfuprog -e</tt>'' a
second time will show that the device is now in DFU mode and ready to
receive downloads.  At this point, either LM Flash Programmer or dfuprog
may be used to send a new application binary to the device.

UART0, connected to the FTDI virtual COM port and running at 115,200,
8-N-1, is used to display messages from this application.
