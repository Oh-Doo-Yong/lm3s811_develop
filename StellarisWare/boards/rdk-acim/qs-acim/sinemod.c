//! \page sinemod_intro Introduction
//!
//! Sine wave modulation is used for driving single-phase AC induction motors
//! and is a method of driving three-phase AC induction motors.  Two or three
//! sine waves, with the appropriate phase shift (180 degrees for single-phase
//! motors and 120 degrees for three-phase motors) are produced.
//!
//! For single-phase motors, this produces an alternating current in the single
//! motor winding, exactly as would be seen by simply connecting the motor to
//! the mains power.  The amplitude of the voltage applied to the motor is the
//! full DC bus voltage.
//!
//! For three-phase motors, this produces an alternating current between each
//! winding pair.  The difference between sine waves that are 120 degrees out
//! of phase is a sine wave with an amplitude of ~86.6% the amplitude of the
//! original sine waves.  Therefore, the full DC bus is not utilized.
//!
//! In order to obtain full DC bus utilization with three-phase motors,
//! over-modulation is supported by specifying an amplitude greater than one.
//! With over-modulation, the portion of the sine wave that is greater than
//! one is clipped to one and the portion less than negative one is clipped to
//! negative one.  During the portion of the sine wave that has been
//! flat-topped, the phase-to-phase current will exceed 86.6%; once the pair
//! of flat-tops start to line up, full DC bus utilization will be achieved.
//! This downside to over-modulation is an increase in the harmonic distortion
//! of the drive waveforms.
//!
//! The code for producing sine wave modulated waveforms is contained in
//! <tt>sinemod.c</tt>, with <tt>sinemod.h</tt> containing the definition for
//! the function exported to the remainder of the application.

//! Computes sine wave modulated waveforms.
//!
//! \param ulAngle is the current angle of the waveform expressed as a 0.32
//! fixed point value that is the percentage of the way around a circle.
//! \param ulAmplitude is the amplitude of the waveform, as a 16.16 fixed point
//! value.
//! \param pulDutyCycles is a pointer to an array of three unsigned longs to be
//! filled in with the duty cycles of the waveforms, in 16.16 fixed point
//! values between zero and one.
//!
//! This function finds the duty cycle percentage of the sine waveforms for the
//! given angle.  For three-phase operation, there are three waveforms
//! produced, each 120 degrees apart.  For single-phase operation, there are
//! two waveforms produced, each 180 degrees apart.  If the amplitude of the
//! waveform is larger than one, the waveform will be clipped after scaling
//! (flat-topping).

//! \return None.
