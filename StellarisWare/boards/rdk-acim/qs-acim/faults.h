//! \page faults_intro Introduction
//!
//! There are several fault conditions that can occur during the operation of
//! the motor drive.  Those fault conditions are enumerated here and provide
//! the definition of the fault status read-only parameter and real-time data
//! item.
//!
//! The faults are:
//!
//! - Emergency stop: This occurs as a result of a command request.  An
//! emergency stop is one where the motor is stopped immediately without
//! regard for trying to maintain normal control of it (this is, without the
//! normal deceleration ramp).  From the motor drive perspective, the motor is
//! left to its own devices to stop, meaning it will coast to a stop under the
//! influence of friction unless a mechanical braking mechanism is provided.
//!
//! - DC bus under-voltage: This occurs when the voltage level of the DC bus
//! drops too low.  Typically, this is the result of the loss of mains power.
//!
//! - DC bus over-voltage: This occurs when the voltage level of the DC bus
//! rises too high.  When the motor is being decelerated, it becomes a
//! generator, increasing the voltage level of the DC bus.  If the level of
//! regeneration is more than can be controlled, the DC bus will rise to a
//! dangerous level and could damage components on the board.
//!
//! - Motor under-current: This occurs when the current through the motor drops
//! too low.  Typically, this is the result of an open connection to the motor.
//!
//! - Motor over-current: This occurs when the current through the motor rises
//! too high.  When the motor is being accelerated, more current flows through
//! the windings than when running at a set speed.  If accelerated too quickly,
//! the current through the motor may rise above the current rating of the
//! motor or of the motor drive, possibly damaging either.
//!
//! - Power module fault: This occurs when the smart power module detects a
//! fault condition.  The smart power module will signal a fault on a supply
//! under-voltage condition and an output over-current condition.
//!
//! - Ambient over-temperature: This occurs when the case temperature of the
//! microcontrollers rises too high.  The motor drive generates lots of heat;
//! if in an enclosure with inadequate ventilation, the heat could rise high
//! enough to exceed the operating range of the motor drive components and/or
//! cause physical damage to the board.  Note that the temperature measurement
//! that is of more interest is directly on the heat sink where the smart
//! power module is attached, though this would require an external
//! thermocouple in order to measure.
//!
//! The definitions for the fault conditions are contained in
//! <tt>faults.h</tt>.
