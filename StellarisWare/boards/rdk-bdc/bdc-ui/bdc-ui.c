//! <h1>Brushed DC User Interface (bdc-ui)</h1>
//!
//! This application provides a simple user interface for the Brushed DC Motor
//! Controller board, running on the EK-LM3S2965 board and communicating over
//! CAN.  In addition to running the motor, the motor status can be viewed, the
//! CAN network enumerated, and the motor controller's firmware can be updated.
//!
//! The direction buttons (left, right, up, and down) on the left side of the
//! EK-LM3S2965 are used to navigate through the user interface, and the select
//! button on the right side of the EK-LM3S2965 is used to select items.
//!
//! The user interface is divided into several panels; the top line of the
//! display always contains the name of the current panel.  By moving the
//! cursor to the top line and pressing select, a menu is displayed which will
//! allow a different panel to be displayed by pressing select again.
//!
//! Of the control modes available via this application, only voltage control
//! mode is usable with the motor and power supply provided with the RDK-BDC.
//! In order to use current control mode, a larger motor (with an attached
//! load) and power supply are required.  In order to use speed control mode, a
//! motor with an encoder is required.  In order to use position control mode,
//! a motor with an encoder or a potentiometer is required.
//!
//! The panels in the user interface will be individually discussed below.  At
//! startup, the Voltage Control Mode panel is displayed first.
//!
//!
//! \addtogroup example_list
//! <b>Voltage Control Mode</b>
//!
//! The voltage control mode panel allows the motor to be controlled by
//! directly selecting the output voltage.  The speed of the motor is directly
//! proportional to the voltage applied, and applying a ``negative'' voltage
//! (in other words, electronically reversing the power and ground connections)
//! will result in the motor spinning in the opposite direction.
//!
//! There are three parameters that can be adjusted on this panel: the ID,
//! voltage, and ramp rate.  The up and down buttons are used to select the
//! parameter to be modified, and the left and right buttons are used to adjust
//! the parameter's value.  The following parameters can be adjusted:
//!
//! - ID, which selects the motor controller to which commands are sent.  If
//!   the ID is changed while the motor is running, the motor will be stopped.
//!
//!   If the select button is pressed, a demonstration mode will be enabled or
//!   disabled.  In demonstration mode, the output voltage is automatically
//!   cycled through a sequence of values.
//!
//! - Voltage, which specifies the output voltage sent from the motor
//!   controller to the motor.  A positive voltage will result in voltage being
//!   applied to the white output terminal and ground being applied to the
//!   green output terminal, while a negative voltage will apply voltage to the
//!   green output terminal and ground to the white output terminal.
//!
//!   If the select button is pressed, changes to the output voltage will not
//!   be sent to the motor controller immediately (allowing the ramp to be
//!   used).  The text color of the voltage changes from white to black to
//!   indicate that a deferred update is active.  Pressing select again will
//!   send the final output voltage to the motor controller.
//!
//! - Ramp, which specifies the rate of change of the output voltage.  When set
//!   to ``none'', the output voltage will change immediately.  When set to a
//!   value, the output voltage is slowly changed from the current to to the
//!   target value at the specified rate.  This can be used to avoid browning
//!   out the power supply or to avoid over-torquing the motor on startup
//!   (for example preventing a loss of traction when a wheel is being driven).
//!
//! The bottom portion of the panel provides the current motor controller
//! status.
//!
//!
//! \addtogroup example_list
//! <b>Current Control Mode</b>
//!
//! The current control panel allows the motor to be controlled via closed-loop
//! current control.  The torque of the motor is directly proportional to the
//! current applied, and applying a ``negative'' current will result in the
//! motor spinning in the opposite direction.
//!
//! There are five parameters that can be adjusted on this panel: the ID,
//! current, and PID parameters.  The up and down buttons are used to select
//! the parameter to be modified, and the left and right buttons are used to
//! adjust the parameter's value.  The following parameters can be adjusted:
//!
//! - ID, which selects the motor controller to which commands are sent.  If
//!   the ID is changed while the motor is running, the motor will be stopped.
//!
//!   If the select button is pressed, a demonstration mode will be enabled or
//!   disabled.  In demonstration mode, the output current is automatically
//!   cycled through a sequence of values.
//!
//! - Current, which specifies the output current sent from the motor
//!   controller to the motor.  A positive current will result in voltage being
//!   applied to the white output terminal and ground being applied to the
//!   green output terminal, while a negative current will apply voltage to the
//!   green output terminal and ground to the white output terminal.
//!
//!   If the select button is pressed, changes to the output current will not
//!   be sent to the motor controller immediately (allowing an arbitrary step
//!   function to be applied).  The text color of the current changes from
//!   white to black to indicate that a deferred update is active.  Pressing
//!   select again will send the final output current to the motor controller.
//!
//! - P coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the instantaneous
//!   motor current error.
//!
//! - I coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the integral of the
//!   motor current error.
//!
//! - D coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the derivitive of the
//!   motor current error.
//!
//! The bottom portion of the panel provides the current motor controller
//! status.
//!
//!
//! \addtogroup example_list
//! <b>Speed Control Mode</b>
//!
//! The speed control panel allows the motor to be controlled via closed-loop
//! speed control.  The voltage applied to the motor is varied in order to
//! achieve a desired output speed.  Applying a ``negative'' speed will result
//! in the motor spinning in the opposite direction.
//!
//! The speed control mode requires that an encoder be attached to the output
//! of the motor, either directly to the motor's output shaft or at some stage
//! within or after the gearbox that is optionally attached to the motor.
//! Examples of encoders that can be used are quadrature encoders and gear
//! tooth sensors.  The speed will be regulated based on the measurement point;
//! if the output speed of a gearbox is measured, then the motor will be
//! running faster or slower than the desired speed (based on the gear ratio of
//! the gearbox) in order to make the gearbox output match the set speed.
//!
//! There are five parameters that can be adjusted on this panel: the ID,
//! speed, and PID parameters.  The up and down buttons are used to select the
//! parameter to be modified, and the left and right buttons are used to adjust
//! the parameter's value.  The following parameters can be adjusted:
//!
//! - ID, which selects the motor contorller to which commands are sent.  If
//!   the ID is changed while the motor is running, the motor will be stopped.
//!
//!   If the select button is pressed, a demonstratino mode will be enabled or
//!   disabled.  In demonstratino mode, the output speed is automatically
//!   cycled through a sequence of values.
//!
//! - Speed, which specifies the speed that the motor should run.  A positive
//!   speed will result in voltage being applied to the white output terminal
//!   and groud being applied to the green output terminal, while a negative
//!   speed will apply voltage to the green output terminal and ground to the
//!   white output terminal.
//!
//!   If the select button is pressed, changes to the output speed will not be
//!   sent to the motor controller immediately (allowing an arbitrary step
//!   function to be applied).  The text color of the speed changes from white
//!   to black to indicate that a deferred update is active.  Pressing select
//!   again will send the final output speed to the motor controller.
//!
//! - P coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the instantaneous
//!   motor speed error.
//!
//! - I coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the integral of the
//!   motor speed error.
//!
//! - D coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the derivitive of the
//!   motor speed error.
//!
//! The bottom portion of the panel provides the current motor controller
//! status.
//!
//!
//! \addtogroup example_list
//! <b>Position Control Mode</b>
//!
//! The position control panel allows the motor to be controlled via
//! closed-loop position control.  The voltage applied to the motor is varied
//! in order to move the shaft to a desired position.  The motor will spin in
//! either direction in order to achieve the requested position.
//!
//! There are six parameters that can be adjusted on this panel: the ID,
//! position, PID parameters, and position reference.  The up and down buttons
//! are used to select the parameter to be modified, and the left and right
//! buttons are used to adjust the parameter's value.  The following parameters
//! can be adjusted:
//!
//! - ID, which selects the motor controller to which commands are sent.  If
//!   the ID is changed while the motor is running, the motor will be stopped.
//!
//!   If the select button is pressed, a demonstration mode will be enabled or
//!   disabled.  In demonstratino mode, the motor position is automatically
//!   cycled through a sequence of values.
//!
//! - Position, which specifies the position to which the motor should turn.
//!
//!   If the select button is pressed, changes to the position will not be sent
//!   to the motor contorller immediately (allowing an arbitrary step funciton
//!   to be applied).  The text color of the position changes from white to
//!   black to indicate that a deferred update is active.  Pressing select
//!   again will send the final output position to the motor controller.
//!
//! - P coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the instantaneous
//!   motor position error.
//!
//! - I coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the integral of the
//!   motor position error.
//!
//! - D coefficient, which specifies the gain applied to the derivitive of the
//!   motor position error.
//!
//! - Position reference, which specifies how the motor position is measured.
//!   If this is set to ``encoder'', an encoder (such as a quadrature encoder)
//!   is used to measure the motor position (a gear tooth sensor can not be
//!   used with position control mode).  If this is set to ``potentiometer'', a
//!   potentiometer coupled to the motor output shaft (pre- or post-gearbox) is
//!   used to measure the motor position.
//!
//! The bottom portion of the panel provides the current motor controller
//! status.
//!
//!
//! \addtogroup example_list
//! <b>Configuration</b>
//!
//! This panel allows general parameters of the motor controller to be
//! configured.  There are ten parameters that can be adjusted on this panel:
//! the ID, number of encoder lines, number of potentiometer turns, brake or
//! coast, soft limit switch enable, forward soft limit switch position,
//! forward soft limit switch comparison, reverse soft limit switch position,
//! reverse soft limit switch comparison, and maximum output voltage.  The up
//! and down buttons are used to select the parameter to be modified, and the
//! left and right buttons are used to adjust the parameter's value.  The
//! following parameters can be adjusted:
//!
//! - ID, which selects the motor controller that is to be configured.
//!
//! - Encoder lines, which specifies the number of lines in the attached
//!   encoder.  When using a quadrature encoder, this number will match the
//!   clocks per revolution (CPR) specified by the encoder manufacturer.  When
//!   using a gear tooth sensor, this will be twice the number of teeth in the
//!   gear that is being measured.
//!
//! - Potentiometer turns, which specifies the number of full turn in the
//!   travel of the potentiometer.  Typical potentiometers used for rotational
//!   measurement have one, three, five, or ten turns in their travel.
//!
//! - Brake/coast, which specifies the action to be taken when the motor is
//!   stopped.  This can be set to ``jumper'', which uses the brake/coast
//!   jumper on the MDL-BDC to determine whether to brake or coast, ``brake''
//!   to apply dynamic braking, and ``coast'' to electrically disconnect the
//!   motor windings and allow it to coast to a stop under the affects of
//!   friction.
//!
//! - Soft limit, which specifies whether or not the soft limit switches are
//!   enabled.  When enabled, the soft limit switches use measured motor
//!   position to prevent the motor from running forward or backward.  For
//!   positioning applications, which require either an encoder or a
//!   potentiometer, this allows the use of limit switches (to prevent
//!   rotational extremes, thereby protecting the attached assembly) without
//!   the need to physically place and wire up real switches.
//!
//! - Forward limit, which specifies the motor position that corresponds to the
//!   position of the forward soft limit switch.
//!
//! - Forward compare, which specifies the comparison applied to the forward
//!   soft limit switch.  This will be ``lt'' if the motor position must be
//!   less than the position of the forward limit switch in order to run
//!   forward, or ``gt'' if it must be greater.  The ``lt'' setting will be
//!   used for setups where positive voltage applied to the motor results in
//!   the measured motor position increasing, and ``gt'' will be used for
//!   setups where positive voltage results in the measured motor position
//!   decreasing.
//!
//! - Reverse limit, which specifies the motor position that corresopnds to the
//!   position of the reverse soft limit switch.
//!
//! - Reverse compare, which specifies the comparison applied to the reverse
//!   soft limit switch.  This will be ``lt'' if the motor position must be
//!   less than the position of the reverse limit switch in order to run
//!   backward, or ``gt'' if it must be greater.  The ``gt'' setting will be
//!   used for setups where positive voltage applied to the motor results in
//!   the measured motor position increasing, and ``lt'' will be used for
//!   setups where positive voltage results in the measured motor position
//!   decreasing.
//!
//! - Maximum output voltage, which specifies the maximum voltage that can be
//!   safely applied to the attached motor.  All voltage commands are scaled
//!   such that a ``full scale'' voltage output matches this value.  This can
//!   be used to attach 7.2V motor (for example) to the MDL-BDC and avoid
//!   applying 12V to them.
//!
//!
//! \addtogroup example_list
//! <b>Device List</b>
//!
//! This panel lists the motor controllers that reside on the CAN network.  All
//! 63 possible device IDs are listed, with those that are not present shown in
//! a dark gray and those that are present in a bright white.  By moving the
//! cursor to a particular ID and pressing the select button, a device ID
//! assignment will be performed.  The motor controller(s) will wait for five
//! seconds after an assignment request for its button to be pressed,
//! indicating that it should accept the device ID assignment.  So, for
//! example, if there are three motor controllers on a network, the following
//! sequence can be used to give them each unique IDs:
//!
//! - Move the cursor to number 1 and press select.  The LED on all three motor
//!   controllers will blink green to indicate that assignment mode is active.
//!
//! - Press the button on one of the motor controllers.  It will blink its LED
//!   yellow one time to indicate that it's ID is one.
//!
//! - Move the cursor to number 2 and press select.
//!
//! - Press the button on the second motor controller.  It will blink its LED
//!   yellow two times to indicate that it's ID is two.
//!
//! - Move the cursor to number 3 and press select.
//!
//! - Press the button on the third motor controller.  It will blink its LED
//!   yellow three times to indicate that it's ID is three.
//!
//! Once complete, this panel will then show that there are devices at IDs 1,
//! 2, and 3.
//!
//!
//! \addtogroup example_list
//! <b>Firmware Update</b>
//!
//! This panel allows the firmware on the motor controller to be updated over
//! the CAN network.  A firmware image for the motor controller is stored in
//! the flash of the EK-LM3S2965 board and used to update the motor controller.
//! The local copy of the motor controller firmware can be updated using the
//! UART boot loader protocol to transfer the image from a PC.  When the UART
//! ``update'' begins, this panel will automatically be displayed.
//!
//! The ID of the motor controller to be updated can be changed on this panel.
//! By using the local firmware image, multiple motor controllers can be
//! updated (one at a time) using this panel, without the need to redownload
//! from a PC each time.
//!
//! When not updating, the firmware version of the currently selected motor
//! controller will be displayed.  If there is no motor controller on the CAN
//! network with the current ID, the firmware version will be displayed as
//! ``---''.
//!
//! By pressing the select button when the ``Start'' button is highlighted, the
//! update of the motor controller firmware will commence.
//!
//! When the firmware is being transferred (either from the PC using the UART
//! or to the motor controller using the CAN network), the ID, firmware
//! version, and ``Start'' buttons will all be grayed out.  A progress bar will
//! appear below them to indicate what is happening and the how far it is
//! through the process.
//!
