Quickstart Security Keypad

This application provides a security keypad to allow access to a door.
Upon entry of the correct access code, a call is made to a function which
could be used to set the state of a relay to activate an electric door
strike, unlocking the door.

The screen is divided into three parts; the Texas Instruments banner across
the top, a hint across the bottom, and the main application area in the
middle (which is the only portion that should appear if this application
is used for a real door access system).  The hints provide an on-screen
guide to what the application is expecting at any given time.

Upon startup, the screen is blank and the hint says to touch the screen.
Pressing the screen will bring up the keypad, which is randomized as an
added security measure (so that an observer can not ``steal'' the access
code by simply looking at the relative positions of the button presses).
The current access code is provided in the hint at the bottom of the screen
(which is clearly not secure).

If an incorrect access code is entered (``#'' ends the code entry), then
the screen will go blank and wait for another access attempt.  If the
correct access code is entered, the ``relay'' will be toggled for a few
seconds (as indicated by the hint at the bottom stating that the door is
open) and the screen will go blank.  Once the door is closed again, the
screen can be touched again to repeat the process.

The UART is used to output a log of events.  Each event in the log is time
stamped, with the arbitrary date of February 26, 2008 at 14:00 UT
(universal time) being the starting time when the application is run.  The
following events are logged:

- The start of the application
- The access code being changed
- Access being granted (correct access code being entered)
- Access being denied (incorrect access code being entered)
- The door being relocked after access has been granted

Input received by the application via the UART is interpreted as various
commands which can be used to query the current access code, set a new code,
show some statistics regarding the number of successful and unsuccessful
access attempts and initiate a firmware update.

When the access code is changed, if a micro-SD card is present, the new
code will be stored in a file called ``key.txt'' in the root directory.
This file is read at startup to initialize the access code.  If a micro-SD
card is not present, or the ``key.txt'' file does not exist, the access
code defaults to 6918.

If ``**'' is entered on the numeric keypad, the application provides
a demonstration of the Stellaris Graphics Library with various panels
showing the available widget type and graphics primitives.  Navigate
between the panels using buttons marked ``+'' and ``-'' at the bottom of
the screen and return to keypad mode by pressing the ``X'' buttons
which appear when you are on either the first or last demonstration
panel.

UART0, which is connected to the 3 pin header on the underside of the
IDM-L35 RDK board (J3), is configured for 115,200 bits per second, and
8-n-1 mode.  When the program is started a message will be printed to the
terminal.  Type ``help'' for command help.

This application supports remote software update via the serial interface
using the LM Flash Programmer application.  A firmware update is initiated
either by entering ``*0'' on the numeric keypad or entering command
``swupd'' on the serial terminal command line.

UART0, which is connected to the 6 pin header on the underside of the
IDM-L35 RDK board (J8), is configured for 115200bps, and 8-n-1 mode.  The
USB-to-serial cable supplied with the IDM-L35 RDK may be used to connect
this TTL-level UART to the host PC to allow firmware update.
